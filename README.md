# Tetris-rs

> This is in a **VERY** early stage. I am working in a refactoring of [this](https://github.com/MrRobb/Artificial-Intelligence/tree/master/Tetris%20AI) but made in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) which is basically C++ but with steroids.

It is a cross-platform Tetris environment with an extremely simple AI that evolves with genetic algorithms. Nothing too fancy. Yet.

### Download

I have barely started it so, **I will upload binaries once it is finished**.

### Build

_You definitely do not want to this._

```sh
cargo build                 # debug
cargo build --release       # release
```

### Usage

_You definitely do not want to this._

```
cargo run                   # debug
cargo run --release         # release
```
